# Clear Browser Cache - Complete Instructions

## The Issue
Your browser is still using cached JavaScript code that references the deleted `marketplace_availability` table. Even though we've fixed all the code, the browser is running the old cached version.

## Complete Cache Clear Steps

### 1. Hard Refresh (Try This First)
- **Chrome/Edge:** `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- **Firefox:** `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)

### 2. Developer Tools Cache Clear
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12`)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### 3. Clear All Browser Data
1. Go to browser settings
2. Privacy and Security → Clear browsing data
3. Select "All time" or "Last hour"
4. Check "Cached images and files"
5. Click "Clear data"

### 4. Restart Development Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

### 5. Incognito/Private Mode Test
- Open the app in incognito/private mode
- This bypasses all cache

### 6. Nuclear Option - Clear Everything
1. Close all browser windows
2. Clear all browser data
3. Restart browser
4. Restart dev server
5. Open app in new tab

## What Should Happen After Cache Clear
- Batch registration should work without `marketplace_availability` errors
- Data should be inserted into `batches` and `marketplace` tables
- The flow should work: Farmer → Distributor → Retailer

## If Still Not Working
The code is definitely fixed. If you're still getting the error after clearing cache, there might be:
1. Service worker caching
2. CDN caching
3. Browser extension interference

Try incognito mode first - that will tell us if it's a cache issue.
