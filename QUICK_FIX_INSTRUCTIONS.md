# Quick Fix Instructions

## The Problem
The error `column transactions.timestamp does not exist` occurs because the database table has a different column name than expected.

## The Solution

### Step 1: Fix the Database Table
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Open the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_transactions_table.sql`
4. Run the SQL

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** This will delete any existing transaction data and recreate the table with the correct schema.

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Go to your app's marketplace
2. Check if the quantity display is now correct
3. Try registering a new batch
4. Verify that it shows the correct available quantity

## What Was Fixed

1. **Column Name Issue**: Changed `timestamp` to `transaction_timestamp` in the database schema
2. **Quantity Display**: Fixed the logic to show original harvest quantity when no transactions exist
3. **Error Handling**: Added proper fallbacks when the transactions table doesn't exist or has errors

## Expected Behavior After Fix

- New batches should show the full harvest quantity as available
- No more "column does not exist" errors
- Quantity calculations should work correctly
- Transaction system should work properly

## If You Still See Issues

1. Make sure you ran the SQL in Supabase
2. Check that the table was created successfully
3. Try refreshing your browser
4. Check the browser console for any remaining errors

The system should now work correctly! üéâ
